# Beginner Python Final Project

This is my final project from UCSB's Introduction to Python course.

## 🧾 Files

- `main.py` – Main driver script
- `functions.py` – Supporting functions
- `tests.py` – Unit tests

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Functions and control flow
- File handling
- Modular programming
- Unit testing with `assert`

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3
- VS Code / Terminal
- Git + GitHub

---

📌 **Why this matters:** I use this as a starting point to pursue data science, AI, and software internships by showing real code I've written and tested.

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/analauracisneros/beginner-python-final-project.git
cd beginner-python-final-project
python3 main.py
